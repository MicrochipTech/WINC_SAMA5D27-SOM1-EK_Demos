# Wifi Provisioning via WPS

This example compiles the Wifi Provisioning via WPS application which is used to provision a WiFi connection.

## Description

In this demonstration, the WINC Driver will move into WPS mode â€“ PIN or PBC. By activating the WPS mode in the AP concurrently, a WiFi connection is established.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://bitbucket.microchip.com/projects/WSGSW/repos/wireless_wifi)


Path of the application within the repository is **apps/wifi_provisioning_via_wps/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.
